<h3>This game was created in collaboration with Leanne Henry. I created all of the weapons used and the functionality for each. This included the weapons that were able to be picked up from the ground. 
    I also created the functionality for the pushable blocks and remade the bow room from scratch. Along with this, I created the player and enemy damage aesthetics and death sprites. I also aided with the audio and health of player and enemies.</h3>
