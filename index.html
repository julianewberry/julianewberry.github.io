<h3>Project Contribution:</h3>
<p>This game was created in collaboration with Leanne Henry. I created all of the weapons used and the functionality for each. This included the weapons that were able to be picked up from the ground. 
    I also created the functionality for the pushable blocks and remade the bow room from scratch. Along with this, I created the player and enemy damage aesthetics and death sprites. I also aided with the audio and health of player and enemies.</p>

<h3>Technology Used</h3>

<h3>Project Contribution:</h3>
<p>This game was created for EECS 494 - Video Game Development at UMich. The game is based on normal platformer games, but the movement is different than most. Multiple jumps are allowed and you are encouraged to use jumping to get the fastest possible time.
    The goal is to get back to your spaceship to fly back home. You want to get the best possible time, so try to beat your original time by playing again!
